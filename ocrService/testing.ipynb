Between 1999 and 2002, WorldCom had overstated its pretax  income  by  at  least  $7  billion,  a  deliberate  miscalculation  that  was,  at  the  time,  the  largest  in history.  The company subsequently wrote down about $82 billion (more than 75%) of its reported assets. 2  WorldCom's stock, once valued at $180 billion, became nearly worthless. Seventeen thousand employees lost their jobs; many left the company with worthless retirement accounts. The company's bankruptcy also jeopardized service to WorldCom's 20 million retail customers and on government contracts affecting 80 million Social Security beneficiaries, air traffic control for the Federal Aviation Association,  network  management  for  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  long-distance  services  for both houses of Congress and the General Accounting Office.\n",

These line-cost expenses were a significant cost for all long-distance carriers.\n",

      "LDDS started with about $650,000 in capital but soon accumulated $1.5 million in debt since it lacked the technical expertise to handle the accounts of large companies that had complex switching systems. The company turned to Bernard J. (Bernie) Ebbers, one of its original nine investors, to run things. Ebbers had previously been employed as a milkman, bartender, bar bouncer, car salesman, truck driver, garment factory foreman, high school basketball coach, and hotelier. While he lacked technology experience, Ebbers later joked that his most useful qualification was being 'the meanest SOB they could find.' 4  Ebbers took less than a year to make the company profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ebbers focused the young firm on internal growth, acquiring small long-distance companies with limited  geographic  service  areas  and  consolidating  third-tier  long-distance  carriers  with  larger market  shares.  This  strategy  delivered  economies  of  scale  that  were  critical  in  the  crowded  longdistance  reselling  market.  'Because  the  volume  of  bandwidth  determined  the  costs,  more  money could be made by acquiring larger pipes, which lowered per unit costs,' one observer remarked. 5 LDDS  grew  rapidly  through  acquisitions  across  the  American  South  and  West  and  expanded internationally through acquisitions in Europe and Latin America. (See Exhibit 1 for  a  selection  of mergers between 1991 and 2002.) In 1989, LDDS became a public company through a merger with Advantage Companies, a company that was already trading on Nasdaq. By the end of 1993, LDDS was  the  fourth-largest  long-distance  carrier  in  the  United  States.  After  a  shareholder  vote  in  May 1995, the company officially became known as WorldCom.\n",

The  industry's  basic  market expanded beyond fixed-line transmission of voice and data to include the transport of data packets over fiber-optic cables that could carry voice, data, and video. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted long-distance carriers to compete for local service, transforming the industry's competitive landscape. Companies scrambled to obtain the capability to provide their customers a single source for all telecommunications services.\n",

      "In  1996,  WorldCom  entered  the  local  service  market  by  purchasing  MFS  Communications Company,  Inc., for $12.4 billion.  MFS's  subsidiary,  UUNET,  gave  WorldCom  a  substantial international  presence  and  a  large  ownership  stake  in  the  world's  Internet  backbone.  In  1997, WorldCom  used  its  highly  valued  stock  to  outbid  British  Telephone  and  GTE  (then  the  nation's second-largest  local  phone  company)  to  acquire  MCI,  the  nation's  second-largest  long-distance company. The $42 billion price represented, at the time, the largest takeover in U.S. history. By 1998, WorldCom had become a full-service telecommunications company, able to supply virtually any size business with a full complement of telecom services. WorldCom's integrated service packages and its Internet strengths gave it an advantage over its major competitors, AT&amp;T and Sprint.

We'd get calls from people we didn't even know existed.' WorldCom's finance department at the Mississippi corporate headquarters  maintained  the  corporate  general  ledger,  which  consolidated  information  from  the incompatible legacy  accounting  systems  of  more  than  60  acquired  companies.  WorldCom's headquarters for its network operations, which managed one of the largest Internet carrier businesses in  the  world,  was  based  in  Texas.  The  human  resources  department  was  in  Florida,  and  the  legal department in Washington, D.C.\n",

[Ebbers] did not include the Company's lawyers in his inner circle and appears to have dealt with them only when he felt it necessary. He let them know his displeasure with them personally when they gave advicehowever justified-that he did not like. In sum, Ebbers created a culture in which the legal function was less influential and less welcome than in a healthy corporate environment. c\n",
      "\n",
      "A former manager added, 'Each department had its own rules and management style. Nobody was on the same page. In fact, when I started in 1995, there were no written policies.' 7  When Ebbers was  told  about  an  internal  effort  to  create  a  corporate  code  of  conduct,  he  called  the  project  a 'colossal waste of time.' d\n",
      "\n",
      "WorldCom encouraged 'a systemic attitude conveyed from the top down that employees should not  question  their  superiors,  but  simply  do  what  they  were  told.' e   Challenges  to  more  senior managers were often met with denigrating personal criticism or threats. In 1999, for example, Buddy Yates,  director  of  WorldCom  General  Accounting,  warned  Gene  Morse,  then  a  senior  manager  at WorldCom's Internet division, UUNET, 'If you show those damn numbers to the f****ing auditors, I'll throw you out the window.' 8\n",

      "\n",
      "In  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  1990s,  WorldCom  focused  on  building  revenues  and  acquiring capacity  sufficient  to  handle  expected  growth.  According  to  Ebbers,  in  1997,  'Our  goal  is  not  to capture market share or be global. Our goal is to be the No. 1 stock on Wall Street.' 10  Revenue growth was  a  key  to  increasing  the  company's  market  value. 11   The  demand  for  revenue  growth  was  'in every brick in every building,' said one manager. g  'The push for revenue encouraged managers to spend whatever was necessary to bring revenue in the door, even if it meant that the long-term costs of a project outweighed short-term gains. . . . As a result, WorldCom entered into long-term fixed rate leases for network capacity in order to meet the anticipated increase in customer demand.' h\n",
      "\n",
      "The  leases  contained  punitive  termination  provisions.  Even  if  capacity  were  underutilized, WorldCom could  avoid  lease  payments  only  by  paying  hefty  termination  fees.  Thus,  if  customer traffic failed to meet expectations, WorldCom would pay for line capacity that it was not using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry conditions began to deteriorate in 2000 due to heightened competition, overcapacity, and the reduced demand for telecommunications services at the onset of the economic recession and the aftermath of the dot-com bubble collapse. Failing telecommunications companies and new entrants were drastically reducing their prices, and WorldCom was forced to match. The competitive situation put severe pressure on WorldCom's most important performance indicator, the E/R ratio (line-cost expenditures to revenues), closely monitored by analysts and industry observers.\n",
      "\n",
      "WorldCom's E/R ratio was about 42% in the first quarter of 2000, and the company struggled to maintain this percentage in subsequent quarters while facing revenue and pricing pressures and its high committed line costs. Ebbers made a personal, emotional speech to senior staff about how he and other directors would lose everything if the company did not improve its performance. i\n",
      "\n",
      "As business operations continued to decline, however, CFO Sullivan decided to use accounting entries  to  achieve  targeted  performance.  Sullivan  and  his  staff  used  two  main  accounting  tactics: accrual releases in 1999 and 2000, and capitalization of line costs in 2001 and 2002. 12\n",
      "\n",
      "## Accrual Releases\n",
      "\n",
      "WorldCom estimated its line costs monthly. Although bills for line costs were often not received or paid until several months after the costs were incurred, generally accepted accounting principles required the company to estimate these expected payments and match this expense with revenues in its income statement. Since the cash for this expense had not yet been paid, the offsetting entry was an accounting accrual to a liability account for the future payment owed to the line owner. When WorldCom paid the bills to the line owner, it reduced the liability accrual by the amount of the cash payment. If bills came in lower than estimated, the company could reverse (or release) some of the accruals, with the excess flowing into the income statement as a reduction in line expenses.\n",

      "\n",
      "12  The company also used aggressive revenue-recognition methods at the end of each reporting quarter to 'close the gap' with Ebbers's aggressive revenue forecasts; see Zekany et al., pp. 112-114, and Beresford, Katzenbach, and Rogers, Jr., pp. 13-16.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout 1999 and 2000, Sullivan told staff to release accruals that he claimed were too high relative  to  future  cash  payments.  Sullivan  apparently  told  several  business  unit  managers  that  the MCI merger had created a substantial amount of such overaccruals. Sullivan directed David Myers (controller) to deal with any resistance from senior managers to the accrual releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one instance, Myers asked David Schneeman, acting CFO of UUNET, to release line accruals for his business unit. When Schneeman asked for an explanation, Myers responded: 'No, you need to book the entry.' When Schneeman refused, Myers told him in another e-mail, 'I guess the only way I am going to get this booked is to fly to D.C. and book it myself. Book it right now, I can't wait another minute.' j   Schneeman  still  refused.  Ultimately,  staff  in  the  general  accounting  department  made Myers's desired changes to the general ledger. (See Exhibit 2 for a partial organizational chart.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In  another  instance,  Myers  asked  Timothy  Schneberger,  director  of  international  fixed  costs,  to release $370 million in accruals. 'Here's your number,' Myers reportedly told Schneberger, asking him to book the $370 million adjustment. Yates, director of General Accounting, told Schneberger the request was from 'the Lord Emperor, God himself, Scott [Sullivan].' When Schneberger refused to make the entry and also refused to provide the account number to enable Myers to make the entry, Betty  Vinson,  a  senior  manager  in  General  Accounting,  obtained  the  account  number  from  a  lowlevel analyst in Schneberger's group and had one of her subordinates make the entry. k  Employees in the  general  accounting  department  also  made  accrual  releases  from  some  departments  without consulting the departments' senior management. In 2000, General Accounting released $281 million against line costs from accruals in the tax department's accounts, an entry that the tax group did not learn about until 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over a seven-quarter  period  between  1999  and  2000,  WorldCom  released  $3.3  billion  worth  of accruals,  most  at  the  direct  request  of  Sullivan  or  Myers.  Several  business  units  were  left  with accruals for future cash payments that were well below the actual amounts they would have to pay when bills arrived in the next period.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expense Capitalization\n",
      "\n",
      "By  the  first  quarter  of  2001,  so  few  accruals  were  left  to  release  that  this  tactic  was  no  longer available to achieve the targeted E/R ratio. l  Revenues, however, continued to decline, and Sullivan, through  his  lieutenants  Myers  and  Yates,  urged  senior  managers  to  maintain  the  42%  E/R  ratio. Senior staff described this target as 'wildly optimistic,' 'pure fantasy,' and 'impossible.' One senior executive  described  the  pressure  as  'unbearable-greater  than  he  had  ever  experienced  in  his fourteen years with the company.' m\n",
      "\n",
      "Sullivan devised a creative solution. He had his staff identify the costs of excess network capacity. He reasoned that these costs could be treated as a capital expenditure, rather than as an operating cost,  since  the  contracted  excess  capacity  gave  the  company  an  opportunity  to  enter  the  market quickly at some future time when demand was stronger than current levels. An accounting manager in 2000 had raised this possibility of treating periodic line costs as a capital expenditure but had been rebuffed  by  Yates:  'David  [Myers]  and  I  have  reviewed  and  discussed  your  logic  of  capitalizing excess capacity and can find no support within the current accounting guidelines that would allow for this accounting treatment.' n\n",

      "Accounting Fraud at WorldCom\n",
      "\n",
      "In  April  2001,  however,  Sullivan  decided  to  stop  recognizing  expenses  for  unused  network capacity. 13   He  directed  Myers  and  Yates  to  order  managers  in  the  company's  general  accounting department to capitalize $771 million of non-revenue-generating line expenses into an asset account, 'construction in progress.' The accounting managers were subsequently told to reverse $227 million of the capitalized amount and to make a $227 million accrual release from ocean-cable liability.\n",

      "WorldCom's April 26, 2001 press release and subsequent 10-Q quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  reported $4.1 billion of line costs and capital expenditures  that  included  $544  million  of  capitalized  line  costs.  With  $9.8  billion  in  reported revenues, WorldCom's line-cost E/R ratio was announced at 42% rather than the 50% it would have been  without  the  reclassification  and  accrual  release. o     ( Exhibit  3 shows  a  selection  of  WorldCom false statements in filings to the SEC.)\n",

      "Betty Vinson, a native of Jackson, Mississippi, joined WorldCom in 1996, when she was 40 years old,  as  a  manager  in  the  international  accounting  division.  She  soon  developed  a  reputation  as  a hardworking, loyal employee who would do 'anything you told her' and often voluntarily worked extra hours at night, while at home, and on vacation. 14  Her good work soon led to a promotion to senior manager in General Accounting. In October 2000, Vinson and her colleague Troy Normand (another manager in General Accounting) were called into their boss's office. Their boss, Yates, told them that Myers and Sullivan wanted them to release $828 million of line accruals into the income statement. Vinson and Normand were 'shocked' by their bosses' proposal and told Yates that the proposal was 'not good accounting.' 15  Yates replied that he was not happy about the transfer either, but after Myers had assured him that it would not happen again, he had agreed to go along. After some  debate,  Vinson  and  Normand  agreed  to  make  the  transfer.  When  the  company  publicly reported  its  third-quarter  results,  however,  Vinson  and  Normand  reconsidered  their  decision  and told Yates that they were planning to resign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ebbers heard about the accountants' concerns and (according to another WorldCom employee) told Myers that the accountants would not be placed in such a difficult position again. A few days later,  Sullivan  talked  to  Vinson  and  Normand  about  their  resignation  plans:  'Think  of  us  as  an aircraft carrier. We have planes in the air. Let's get the planes landed. Once they are landed, if you still want to leave, then leave. But not while the planes are in the air.' 16\n",
      "\n",
      "Sullivan  assured  them  that  they  were  doing  nothing  illegal  and  that  he  would  take  full responsibility for their actions. Vinson decided against quitting. She earned more than her husband, and  her  WorldCom  position  paid  for  the  family's  insurance  benefits.  She  knew  that  it  would  be difficult to find alternative work in the community with comparable compensation.

      "In April 2001, Vinson and Normand were again placed in a difficult position, except this time the position was, from Vinson's perspective, even less defensible. Revenues in the quarter were worse than  expected,  and  Sullivan  wanted  them  to  transfer  $771  million  of  line  costs  into  capital expenditures. 17  Vinson was again shocked at the request but was reluctant to quit without another job.  She  knew  Myers  and  Yates  had  already  acquiesced  to  Sullivan's  request.  It  was  her  job  to distribute the amount across five capital accounts. She felt trapped but eventually made the entries and backdated them to February 2001.\n",

In April  2002,  Yates,  Normand,  and  Vinson  reviewed  the  first-quarter  report,  which  included  $818 million in capitalized line costs. They also learned that achieving Ebbers's projections would require making similar entries for the remainder of the year. They made a pact to stop making such entries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cynthia Cooper, a strong-willed, 38-year-old, nine-year WorldCom veteran, headed WorldCom's 24-member internal audit department. Cooper had grown up in Clinton, Mississippi, WorldCom's headquarters since 1998. Her high school teacher of accounting was the mother of one of her senior auditors. Gene Morse also was working in Internal Audit, as a senior manager; he had transferred after  Yates  threatened  him,  in  October  1999,  about  speaking  to  external  auditors.  Internal  Audit reported  directly  to  CFO  Sullivan  for  most  purposes.  It  conducted  primarily  operational  audits  to measure business unit performance and enforce spending controls. Arthur Andersen, WorldCom's independent  auditors,  performed  the  financial  audits  to  assess  the  reliability  and  integrity  of  the publicly reported financial information. Andersen reported to the audit committee of the company's board of directors. 18\n",
      "\n",
      "In August 2001, Cooper began a routine operational audit of WorldCom's capital expenditures. Sullivan  instructed  Myers  to  restrict  the  scope  of  Cooper's  inquiry:  'We  are  not  looking  for  a comprehensive Capex audit but rather very in depth in certain areas and spending.' Cooper's audit revealed that Corporate had capital expenditures of $2.3 billion. By way of comparison, WorldCom's operations and technology group, which ran the company's entire telecommunications network, had capital  expenditures  of  $2.9  billion.  Internal  Audit  requested  an  explanation  of  Corporate's  $2.3 billion worth of projects. Cooper's team received a revised chart indicating that Corporate had only $174 million in expenditures. A footnote reference in this chart indicated that the remainder of the $2.3 billion included a metro lease buyout, line costs, and some corporate-level accruals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2002, the head of the wireless business unit complained to Cooper about a $400 million accrual  in  his  business  for  expected  future  cash  payments  and  bad-debt  expenses  that  had  been transferred away to pump up company earnings. Both Sullivan and the Arthur Andersen team had supported the transfer. Cooper asked one of the Andersen auditors to explain the transfer, but he\n",
      "\n",
      "17   This figure was subsequently reduced to $544 million when Sullivan and Myers found $227 million worth of accruals that could be released for the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "18  This audit was described as operational in nature, with an emphasis on actual spending in the field, capitalization of labor costs, and cash management. Internal Audit focused on operational and not financial statement audits at this time in order to avoid duplicating the work Andersen was doing; one employee told us that Internal Audit also wanted to avoid being seen as digging in Scott Sullivan's ' backyard' when the group reported to him.

      "\n",
      "Cooper brought the issue to WorldCom's audit committee but was told by Sullivan, after the audit committee meeting, to stay away from the wireless business unit. Cooper recalled Sullivan screaming at her in a way she had never been talked to before, by anyone. p\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in March 2002, SEC investigators sent WorldCom a surprise 'request for information.' The SEC  wanted  to  examine  company  data  to  learn  how  WorldCom  could  be  profitable  while  other telecom companies were reporting large losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooper decided, unilaterally and without informing Sullivan, to expand Internal Audit's scope by conducting a financial audit. Cooper asked Morse, who had good computer expertise, to access the company's computerized journal entries. Such access was granted only with Sullivan's permission, which  they  definitely  did  not  have.  But  Morse,  anticipating  a  need  for  unlimited  access  to  the company's  financial  systems,  had  previously  persuaded  a  senior  manager  in  WorldCom's  IT department to allow him to use the systems to test new software programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The software enabled Morse to find the original journal entry for virtually any expense. Morse worked at night, when his activities were less likely to clog the network. 20  By day, Morse examined his  downloaded materials in the audit library, a small windowless room. He copied incriminating data onto a CD-ROM so that the company could not subsequently destroy the evidence. Morse, a gregarious father of three, was so concerned with secrecy that he did not tell his wife what he was doing and instructed her not to touch his briefcase.\n",

      "## The Outside Auditor: Arthur Andersen\n",
      "\n",
      "WorldCom's independent external auditor  from  1990  to  2002  was  Arthur  Andersen.  Andersen considered  WorldCom  to  be  its  'flagship'  and  most  'highly  coveted'  client,  the  firm's  'Crown Jewel.' q  Andersen viewed its relationship with WorldCom as long term and wanted to be considered as  a  committed  member  of  WorldCom's  team.  One  indicator  of  its  commitment  came  after  the company merged with MCI. Andersen, which had a Mississippi-based team of 10-12 people working full  time  on  WorldCom's  audits,  underbilled  the  company  and  justified  the  lower  charges  as  a continuing investment in its WorldCom relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally,  Andersen  did  its  audit  'the  old-fashioned  way,'  testing  thousands  of  details  of individual  transactions  and  reviewing  and  confirming  account  balances  in  WorldCom's  general ledger.  As  WorldCom's  operations  expanded  through  mergers  and  increased  scope  of  services, Andersen adopted more efficient and sophisticated audit procedures, based on analytic reviews and risk assessments. The auditors focused on identifying risks and assessing whether the client company had adequate controls in place to mitigate  those  risks,  for  example,  for  mistakenly  or  deliberately misrepresenting  financial  data.  In  practice,  Andersen  reviewed  processes,  tested  systems,  and assessed  whether  business  unit  groups  received  correct  information  from  the  field.  Its  auditors assumed that the information recorded by General Accounting was valid. It typically requested the same  20  to  30  schedules  of  high-level  summaries  to  review  each  quarter,  including  a  schedule  of\n",

      "\n",
      "topside entries made by General Accounting directly to the corporate general ledger after the close of a quarter. r\n",
      "\n",
      "Andersen  also  assessed  the  risk  that  expenditures  for  payroll,  spare  parts,  movable  parts,  and capital projects were being properly recorded and classified as expenses or assets by reviewing the relevant approval process. For line costs, Andersen assessed the risk that line-cost liabilities might be understated or overstated by testing whether the domestic telco accounting group received accurate information from the field. It did not perform comparable tests for the international line-cost group even after WorldCom employees told Andersen's U.K. audit team about a corporate reversal of $34 million in line-cost accruals after the first quarter of 2000. s  Andersen focused primarily on the risk that  WorldCom  revenues  would  be  misstated  because  of  errors  or  inaccurate  records,  not  by deliberate misrepresentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 1999 and 2001, Andersen's risk management software program rated WorldCom as a 'high-risk' client for committing fraud, a conclusion that its auditors upgraded to 'maximum risk' because  of volatility  in  the  telecommunications  industry,  the  company's  active  merger  and acquisition  plans,  and  its  reliance  on  a  high  stock  price  for  acquisitions.  The  Andersen  concurring partner  said  at  the  time  of  the  1999  risk  upgrade,  'If  this  job  is  not  maximum,  none  are.' t   The engagement  manager  stated  that  there  were  'probably  few  other  engagements  where  [Andersen] ha[d] a higher risk.'\n",
      "\n",
      "But  the  Andersen  audit  team  for  WorldCom  did  not  modify  its  analytic  audit  approach  and continued  to  audit  WorldCom  as  a  'moderate-risk'  client.  Andersen  could  have  identified  the fraudulent  topside  entries  (accrual  reversals  and  capitalized  line  costs)  from  a  review  of  the company's  general  ledger,  its  primary  transactional  accounting  record. u   WorldCom,  however, repeatedly refused Andersen's request to access the computerized general ledger. Also, Andersen's analytic  review  procedures,  properly  performed,  should  have  triggered  a  search  for  accounting irregularities when WorldCom's quarterly financial statements reported stable financial ratios during a period of severe decline in the telecommunications industry: '[M]anagement's ability to continue to meet  aggressive  revenue  growth  targets,  and  maintain  a  42%  line  cost  expense-to-revenue  ratio, should have raised questions. Instead of wondering how this could be, Andersen appeared to have been comforted by the absence of variances. Indeed, this absence led Andersen to conclude that no follow-up work was required.' v\n",
      "\n",
      "Myers,  Stephanie  Scott,  and  Mark  Willson  instructed  WorldCom  staff  about  what  information could and could not be shared with Andersen. When Andersen auditors asked to speak with Ronald Lomenzo, senior vice president of financial operations, who oversaw international line-cost accruals, the request was refused. One employee commented: 'Myers or Stephanie Scott would never permit it to happen.' w  In 1998, WorldCom's treasurer told the person in charge of security for WorldCom's computerized  consolidation  and  financial  reporting  system  never  to  give  Andersen  access.  One employee  said  that  she  was  specifically  instructed  not  to  tell  Andersen  that  senior  management orchestrated adjustments to domestic line-cost accruals. Myers told one employee who had continued to  talk  with  Andersen's  U.K.  auditors,  'Do  not  have  any  more  meetings  with  Andersen  for  any reason. . . . Mark Willson has already told you this once. Don't make me ask you again.' x\n",
      "\n",
      "WorldCom also  withheld  information,  altered  documents,  omitted  information  from  requested materials, and transferred millions of dollars in account balances to mislead Andersen. In fact, special monthly revenue reports were prepared for Andersen:\n",
      "\n",
      "WorldCom  provided  Andersen  with  altered  MonRevs  [monthly  revenue  reports]  that removed  several  of  the  more  transparently  problematic  revenue  items  from  the  Corporate Unallocated schedule, and buried the revenue for these items elsewhere in the report. . . . After\n",

      "the third quarter of 2001, Stephanie Scott became concerned about how Andersen would react to the size of Corporate Unallocated revenue. . . . In the version prepared for Andersen, the Corporate Unallocated revenue items could no longer be identified by name and amount. . . . These items were removed from the Corporate Unallocated schedule and subsumed within a sales region's total revenue number. y\n",

      "\n",
      "Between 1999 and 2002, nonexecutive members made up more than 50% of WorldCom's Board of Directors.  The  board  members,  most  of  whom  were  former  owners,  officers,  or  directors  of companies  acquired  by  WorldCom,  included  experts  in  law,  finance,  and  the  telecommunications industry (see Exhibit 4 ).  Bert Roberts, Jr., former CEO of MCI, was chairman from 1998 until 2002. His actual role, however, was honorary. CEO Ebbers presided over board meetings and determined their agendas.\n",

With  the  occasional  exception  of  Bobbitt (Audit) and Kellett (Compensation), none of the outside directors had regular communications with Ebbers, Sullivan, or any other WorldCom employee outside of board or committee meetings. Prior to April 2002, the outside directors never met by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "A  week  prior  to  board  meetings  directors  received  a  packet  of  information  that  contained  an agenda,  financial  information  from  the  previous  quarter,  draft  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting, investor  relations  information  such  as  analyst  call  summaries,  and  resolutions  to  consider  at  the upcoming meeting. The meetings consisted of a series of short presentations from the chairman of the compensation  and  stock  option  committee  about  officer  loans  and  senior  level  compensation;  the chairman of the audit committee; 21  the general counsel, who discussed legal and regulatory issues; CFO Sullivan, who discussed financial issues at a high level of generality for 30 minutes to an hour; and, on occasion, COO Ron Beaumont.

When WorldCom stock began to decline in 2000, Ebbers received margin calls from his bankers. In September 2000, the compensation committee began, at Ebbers's request, to approve loans and guarantees from WorldCom so that Ebbers would not have to sell his stock to meet the margin calls. The full board learned about the loans to Ebbers in November 2000, since the loans needed to be disclosed in the company's third-quarter 10-Q report. The board ratified  and  approved  the  compensation  committee's  actions.  WorldCom  did  not  receive  any collateral  from  Ebbers  or  his  business  interests  to  secure  these  loans.  Nor  did  the  compensation committee  oversee  Ebbers's  use  of  the  funds,  some  of  which  were  used  to  pay  his  companies' operating expenses.

On June 13, 2002, after a sixweek trial and 10 days of deliberations, jurors convicted Arthur Andersen for obstructing justice for its destruction of Enron documents while on notice of a federal investigation.

In October 2002, Yates, Vinson, and Normand each pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, charges that carried a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Vinson was released on a bond secured by $25,000 of equity in her home. She was now working as an accountant for a large Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. 26  On March 2, 2004, Sullivan pleaded guilty to federal fraud and conspiracy charges that he deceived the public, the SEC, securities analysts, and others about WorldCom's true financial condition.

Rather, there was a broad breakdown of the system of internal controls, corporate governance and individual responsibility, all of which worked together to create a culture in which few persons took responsibility until it was too late .\\n\\n-Richard Thornburgh, former U.S. attorney general 1\\n\\nOn July 21, 2002, WorldCom Group, a telecommunications company with more than $30 billion in revenues,  $104  billion  in  assets,  and  60,000  employees,  filed  for  bankruptcy  protection  under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Between 1999 and 2002, WorldCom had overstated its pretax  income  by  at  least  $7  billion,  a  deliberate  miscalculation  that  was,  at  the  time,  the  largest  in history.  The company subsequently wrote down about $82 billion (more than 75%) of its reported assets. 2  WorldCom's stock, once valued at $180 billion, became nearly worthless. Seventeen thousand employees lost their jobs; many left the company with worthless retirement accounts. The company's bankruptcy also jeopardized service to WorldCom's 20 million retail customers and on government contracts affecting 80 million Social Security beneficiaries, air traffic control for the Federal Aviation Association,  network  management  for  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  long-distance  services  for both houses of Congress and the General Accounting Office.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nWorldCom's origins can be traced to the 1983 breakup of AT&amp;T. Small, regional companies could now gain access to AT&amp;T's long-distance phone lines at deeply discounted rates. 3  LDDS (an acronym for  Long Distance Discount Services) began operations in 1984, offering services to local retail and commercial  customers  in  southern  states  where  well-established  long-distance  companies,  such  as MCI and Sprint, had little presence. LDDS, like other of these small regional companies, paid to use or  lease  facilities  belonging  to  third  parties.  For  example,  a  call  from  an  LDDS  customer  in New Orleans  to  Dallas  might  initiate  on  a  local  phone  company's  line,  flow  to  LDDS's  leased network, and then transfer to a Dallas local phone company to be completed.

       " \"Accounting Fraud at WorldCom\\n\\nNew  Orleans  and  Dallas  phone  company  providers  for  using  their  local  networks,  and  the telecommunications  company  whose  long-distance  network  it  leased  to  connect  New  Orleans  to Dallas. These line-cost expenses were a significant cost for all long-distance carriers.\\n\\nLDDS started with about $650,000 in capital but soon accumulated $1.5 million in debt since it lacked the technical expertise to handle the accounts of large companies that had complex switching systems. The company turned to Bernard J. (Bernie) Ebbers, one of its original nine investors, to run things. Ebbers had previously been employed as a milkman, bartender, bar bouncer, car salesman, truck driver, garment factory foreman, high school basketball coach, and hotelier. While he lacked technology experience, Ebbers later joked that his most useful qualification was being 'the meanest SOB they could find.' 4  Ebbers took less than a year to make the company profitable.\\n\\nEbbers focused the young firm on internal growth, acquiring small long-distance companies with limited  geographic  service  areas  and  consolidating  third-tier  long-distance  carriers  with  larger market  shares.  This  strategy  delivered  economies  of  scale  that  were  critical  in  the  crowded  longdistance  reselling  market.  'Because  the  volume  of  bandwidth  determined  the  costs,  more  money could be made by acquiring larger pipes, which lowered per unit costs,' one observer remarked. 5 LDDS  grew  rapidly  through  acquisitions  across  the  American  South  and  West  and  expanded internationally through acquisitions in Europe and Latin America. (See Exhibit 1 for  a  selection  of mergers between 1991 and 2002.) In 1989, LDDS became a public company through a merger with Advantage Companies, a company that was already trading on Nasdaq. By the end of 1993, LDDS was  the  fourth-largest  long-distance  carrier  in  the  United  States.  After  a  shareholder  vote  in  May 1995, the company officially became known as WorldCom.\\n\\nThe  telecommunications  industry  evolved  rapidly  in  the  1990s.  The  industry's  basic  market expanded beyond fixed-line transmission of voice and data to include the transport of data packets over fiber-optic cables that could carry voice, data, and video. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted long-distance carriers to compete for local service, transforming the industry's competitive landscape. Companies scrambled to obtain the capability to provide their customers a single source for all telecommunications services.\\n\\nIn  1996,  WorldCom  entered  the  local  service  market  by  purchasing  MFS  Communications Company,  Inc., for $12.4 billion.  MFS's  subsidiary,  UUNET,  gave  WorldCom  a  substantial international  presence  and  a  large  ownership  stake  in  the  world's  Internet  backbone.  In  1997, WorldCom  used  its  highly  valued  stock  to  outbid  British  Telephone  and  GTE  (then  the  nation's second-largest  local  phone  company)  to  acquire  MCI,  the  nation's  second-largest  long-distance company. The $42 billion price represented, at the time, the largest takeover in U.S. history. By 1998, WorldCom had become a full-service telecommunications company, able to supply virtually any size business with a full complement of telecom services. WorldCom's integrated service packages and its Internet strengths gave it an advantage over its major competitors, AT&amp;T and Sprint. Analysts hailed Ebbers and Scott Sullivan, the CFO who engineered the MCI merger, as industry leaders. 6\\n\\nIn  1999,  WorldCom  attempted  to  acquire  Sprint,  but  the  U.S.  Justice  Department,  in  July  2000, refused to allow the merger on terms that were acceptable to the two companies. The termination of this merger was a significant event in WorldCom's history. WorldCom executives realized that largescale  mergers  were  no  longer  a  viable  means  of  expanding  the  business. a   WorldCom  employees\\n\\n4  Jeter, p. 27.\\n\\n5  Jeter, p. 30.\\n\\n6 CFO Magazine awarded Sullivan its CFO Excellence award in 1998; Fortune listed Ebbers as one of its 'People to Watch 2001.'\",\n",

Sng, 2025.\\n\\n104-071\\n\\nnoted  that  after  the  turndown  of  the  Sprint  merger,  'Ebbers  appeared  to  lack  a  strategic  sense  of direction, and the Company began drifting.' b\\n\\n## Corporate Culture\\n\\nWorldCom's  growth  through  acquisitions  led  to  a  hodgepodge  of  people  and  cultures.  One accountant recalled, 'We had offices in places we never knew about. We'd get calls from people we didn't even know existed.' WorldCom's finance department at the Mississippi corporate headquarters  maintained  the  corporate  general  ledger,  which  consolidated  information  from  the incompatible legacy  accounting  systems  of  more  than  60  acquired  companies.  WorldCom's headquarters for its network operations, which managed one of the largest Internet carrier businesses in  the  world,  was  based  in  Texas.  The  human  resources  department  was  in  Florida,  and  the  legal department in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nNone of the company's senior lawyers was located in Jackson. [Ebbers] did not include the Company's lawyers in his inner circle and appears to have dealt with them only when he felt it necessary. He let them know his displeasure with them personally when they gave advicehowever justified-that he did not like. In sum, Ebbers created a culture in which the legal function was less influential and less welcome than in a healthy corporate environment. c\\n\\nA former manager added, 'Each department had its own rules and management style. Nobody was on the same page. In fact, when I started in 1995, there were no written policies.' 7  When Ebbers was  told  about  an  internal  effort  to  create  a  corporate  code  of  conduct,  he  called  the  project  a 'colossal waste of time.' d\\n\\nWorldCom encouraged 'a systemic attitude conveyed from the top down that employees should not  question  their  superiors,  but  simply  do  what  they  were  told.' e   Challenges  to  more  senior managers were often met with denigrating personal criticism or threats. In 1999, for example, Buddy Yates,  director  of  WorldCom  General  Accounting,  warned  Gene  Morse,  then  a  senior  manager  at WorldCom's Internet division, UUNET, 'If you show those damn numbers to the f****ing auditors, I'll throw you out the window.' 8\\n\\nEbbers and Sullivan frequently granted compensation beyond the company's approved salary and bonus guidelines for an employee's position to reward selected, and presumably loyal, employees, especially  those  in  the  financial,  accounting,  and  investor  relations  departments.  The  company's human resources department virtually never objected to such special awards. 9\\n\\nEmployees  felt  that  they  did  not  have  an  independent  outlet  for  expressing  concerns  about company policies or behavior. Several were unaware of the existence of an internal audit department, and  others,  knowing  that  Internal  Audit  reported  directly  to  Sullivan,  did  not  believe  it  was  a productive outlet for questioning financial transactions. f\\n\\n7  Jeter, p. 55.\\n\\n8  Personal correspondence, Gene Morse.\\n\\n9   Kay E.

       " \"## For the exclusive use of J. Sng, 2025.\\n\\nAccounting Fraud at WorldCom\\n\\n## Expense-to-Revenue (E/R) Ratio\\n\\nIn  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  1990s,  WorldCom  focused  on  building  revenues  and  acquiring capacity  sufficient  to  handle  expected  growth.  According  to  Ebbers,  in  1997,  'Our  goal  is  not  to capture market share or be global. Our goal is to be the No. 1 stock on Wall Street.' 10  Revenue growth was  a  key  to  increasing  the  company's  market  value. 11   The  demand  for  revenue  growth  was  'in every brick in every building,' said one manager. g  'The push for revenue encouraged managers to spend whatever was necessary to bring revenue in the door, even if it meant that the long-term costs of a project outweighed short-term gains. . . . As a result, WorldCom entered into long-term fixed rate leases for network capacity in order to meet the anticipated increase in customer demand.' h\\n\\nThe  leases  contained  punitive  termination  provisions.  Even  if  capacity  were  underutilized, WorldCom could  avoid  lease  payments  only  by  paying  hefty  termination  fees.  Thus,  if  customer traffic failed to meet expectations, WorldCom would pay for line capacity that it was not using.\\n\\nIndustry conditions began to deteriorate in 2000 due to heightened competition, overcapacity, and the reduced demand for telecommunications services at the onset of the economic recession and the aftermath of the dot-com bubble collapse. Failing telecommunications companies and new entrants were drastically reducing their prices, and WorldCom was forced to match. The competitive situation put severe pressure on WorldCom's most important performance indicator, the E/R ratio (line-cost expenditures to revenues), closely monitored by analysts and industry observers.\\n\\nWorldCom's E/R ratio was about 42% in the first quarter of 2000, and the company struggled to maintain this percentage in subsequent quarters while facing revenue and pricing pressures and its high committed line costs. Ebbers made a personal, emotional speech to senior staff about how he and other directors would lose everything if the company did not improve its performance. i\\n\\nAs business operations continued to decline, however, CFO Sullivan decided to use accounting entries  to  achieve  targeted  performance.  Sullivan  and  his  staff  used  two  main  accounting  tactics: accrual releases in 1999 and 2000, and capitalization of line costs in 2001 and 2002. 12\\n\\n## Accrual Releases\\n\\nWorldCom estimated its line costs monthly. Although bills for line costs were often not received or paid until several months after the costs were incurred, generally accepted accounting principles required the company to estimate these expected payments and match this expense with revenues in its income statement. Since the cash for this expense had not yet been paid, the offsetting entry was an accounting accrual to a liability account for the future payment owed to the line owner. When WorldCom paid the bills to the line owner, it reduced the liability accrual by the amount of the cash payment. If bills came in lower than estimated, the company could reverse (or release) some of the accruals, with the excess flowing into the income statement as a reduction in line expenses.\\n\\n10  R. Charan, J. Useen, and A. Harrington, 'Why Companies Fail,' Fortune (Asia), May 27, 2002, pp. 36-45.\\n\\n11  Zekany et al., p. 103.\\n\\n12  The company also used aggressive revenue-recognition methods at the end of each reporting quarter to 'close the gap' with Ebbers's aggressive revenue forecasts; see Zekany et al., pp. 112-114, and Beresford, Katzenbach, and Rogers, Jr., pp. 13-16.\",\n",
       " \"Throughout 1999 and 2000, Sullivan told staff to release accruals that he claimed were too high relative  to  future  cash  payments.  Sullivan  apparently  told  several  business  unit  managers  that  the MCI merger had created a substantial amount of such overaccruals. Sullivan directed David Myers (controller) to deal with any resistance from senior managers to the accrual releases.\\n\\nIn one instance, Myers asked David Schneeman, acting CFO of UUNET, to release line accruals for his business unit. When Schneeman asked for an explanation, Myers responded: 'No, you need to book the entry.' When Schneeman refused, Myers told him in another e-mail, 'I guess the only way I am going to get this booked is to fly to D.C. and book it myself. Book it right now, I can't wait another minute.' j   Schneeman  still  refused.  Ultimately,  staff  in  the  general  accounting  department  made Myers's desired changes to the general ledger. (See Exhibit 2 for a partial organizational chart.)\\n\\nIn  another  instance,  Myers  asked  Timothy  Schneberger,  director  of  international  fixed  costs,  to release $370 million in accruals. 'Here's your number,' Myers reportedly told Schneberger, asking him to book the $370 million adjustment. Yates, director of General Accounting, told Schneberger the request was from 'the Lord Emperor, God himself, Scott [Sullivan].' When Schneberger refused to make the entry and also refused to provide the account number to enable Myers to make the entry, Betty  Vinson,  a  senior  manager  in  General  Accounting,  obtained  the  account  number  from  a  lowlevel analyst in Schneberger's group and had one of her subordinates make the entry. k  Employees in the  general  accounting  department  also  made  accrual  releases  from  some  departments  without consulting the departments' senior management. In 2000, General Accounting released $281 million against line costs from accruals in the tax department's accounts, an entry that the tax group did not learn about until 2001.\\n\\nOver a seven-quarter  period  between  1999  and  2000,  WorldCom  released  $3.3  billion  worth  of accruals,  most  at  the  direct  request  of  Sullivan  or  Myers.  Several  business  units  were  left  with accruals for future cash payments that were well below the actual amounts they would have to pay when bills arrived in the next period.\\n\\n## Expense Capitalization\\n\\nBy  the  first  quarter  of  2001,  so  few  accruals  were  left  to  release  that  this  tactic  was  no  longer available to achieve the targeted E/R ratio. l  Revenues, however, continued to decline, and Sullivan, through  his  lieutenants  Myers  and  Yates,  urged  senior  managers  to  maintain  the  42%  E/R  ratio. Senior staff described this target as 'wildly optimistic,' 'pure fantasy,' and 'impossible.' One senior executive  described  the  pressure  as  'unbearable-greater  than  he  had  ever  experienced  in  his fourteen years with the company.' m\\n\\nSullivan devised a creative solution. He had his staff identify the costs of excess network capacity. He reasoned that these costs could be treated as a capital expenditure, rather than as an operating cost,  since  the  contracted  excess  capacity  gave  the  company  an  opportunity  to  enter  the  market quickly at some future time when demand was stronger than current levels. An accounting manager in 2000 had raised this possibility of treating periodic line costs as a capital expenditure but had been rebuffed  by  Yates:  'David  [Myers]  and  I  have  reviewed  and  discussed  your  logic  of  capitalizing excess capacity and can find no support within the current accounting guidelines that would allow for this accounting treatment.' n\",\n",
       " \"Accounting Fraud at WorldCom\\n\\nIn  April  2001,  however,  Sullivan  decided  to  stop  recognizing  expenses  for  unused  network capacity. 13   He  directed  Myers  and  Yates  to  order  managers  in  the  company's  general  accounting department to capitalize $771 million of non-revenue-generating line expenses into an asset account, 'construction in progress.' The accounting managers were subsequently told to reverse $227 million of the capitalized amount and to make a $227 million accrual release from ocean-cable liability.\\n\\nWorldCom's April 26, 2001 press release and subsequent 10-Q quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  reported $4.1 billion of line costs and capital expenditures  that  included  $544  million  of  capitalized  line  costs.  With  $9.8  billion  in  reported revenues, WorldCom's line-cost E/R ratio was announced at 42% rather than the 50% it would have been  without  the  reclassification  and  accrual  release. o     ( Exhibit  3 shows  a  selection  of  WorldCom false statements in filings to the SEC.)\\n\\n## General Accounting Department\\n\\nBetty Vinson, a native of Jackson, Mississippi, joined WorldCom in 1996, when she was 40 years old,  as  a  manager  in  the  international  accounting  division.  She  soon  developed  a  reputation  as  a hardworking, loyal employee who would do 'anything you told her' and often voluntarily worked extra hours at night, while at home, and on vacation. 14  Her good work soon led to a promotion to senior manager in General Accounting. In October 2000, Vinson and her colleague Troy Normand (another manager in General Accounting) were called into their boss's office. Their boss, Yates, told them that Myers and Sullivan wanted them to release $828 million of line accruals into the income statement. Vinson and Normand were 'shocked' by their bosses' proposal and told Yates that the proposal was 'not good accounting.' 15  Yates replied that he was not happy about the transfer either, but after Myers had assured him that it would not happen again, he had agreed to go along. After some  debate,  Vinson  and  Normand  agreed  to  make  the  transfer.  When  the  company  publicly reported  its  third-quarter  results,  however,  Vinson  and  Normand  reconsidered  their  decision  and told Yates that they were planning to resign.\\n\\nEbbers heard about the accountants' concerns and (according to another WorldCom employee) told Myers that the accountants would not be placed in such a difficult position again. A few days later,  Sullivan  talked  to  Vinson  and  Normand  about  their  resignation  plans:  'Think  of  us  as  an aircraft carrier. We have planes in the air. Let's get the planes landed. Once they are landed, if you still want to leave, then leave. But not while the planes are in the air.' 16\\n\\nSullivan  assured  them  that  they  were  doing  nothing  illegal  and  that  he  would  take  full responsibility for their actions. Vinson decided against quitting. She earned more than her husband, and  her  WorldCom  position  paid  for  the  family's  insurance  benefits.  She  knew  that  it  would  be difficult to find alternative work in the community with comparable compensation. Moreover, while she and Normand had doubts about the accounting transfers, they believed that Sullivan, with his 'whiz kid' CFO reputation, probably knew what he was doing.\\n\\n13   Sullivan's  rationale,  formally  described  in  a  two-page  white  paper,  was  rejected  by  the  SEC,  independent  auditors,  and WorldCom's own senior managers.\\n\\n14  Susan Pulliman, 'WorldCom Whistleblowing,' The Wall Street Journal , June 23, 2003.\\n\\n15  Ibid.\\n\\n16  Ibid., p. 1.\",\n",
       " \"In April 2001, Vinson and Normand were again placed in a difficult position, except this time the position was, from Vinson's perspective, even less defensible. Revenues in the quarter were worse than  expected,  and  Sullivan  wanted  them  to  transfer  $771  million  of  line  costs  into  capital expenditures. 17  Vinson was again shocked at the request but was reluctant to quit without another job.  She  knew  Myers  and  Yates  had  already  acquiesced  to  Sullivan's  request.  It  was  her  job  to distribute the amount across five capital accounts. She felt trapped but eventually made the entries and backdated them to February 2001.\\n\\nVinson continued to make similar entries throughout 2001 but began losing sleep, withdrawing from  workers,  and  losing  weight.  Each  time  she  hoped  it  would  be  the  last,  yet  the  pressure continued. In early 2002, she received a raise (to roughly $80,000) and a promotion to director. In April  2002,  Yates,  Normand,  and  Vinson  reviewed  the  first-quarter  report,  which  included  $818 million in capitalized line costs. They also learned that achieving Ebbers's projections would require making similar entries for the remainder of the year. They made a pact to stop making such entries.\\n\\n## Internal Audit\\n\\nCynthia Cooper, a strong-willed, 38-year-old, nine-year WorldCom veteran, headed WorldCom's 24-member internal audit department. Cooper had grown up in Clinton, Mississippi, WorldCom's headquarters since 1998. Her high school teacher of accounting was the mother of one of her senior auditors. Gene Morse also was working in Internal Audit, as a senior manager; he had transferred after  Yates  threatened  him,  in  October  1999,  about  speaking  to  external  auditors.  Internal  Audit reported  directly  to  CFO  Sullivan  for  most  purposes.  It  conducted  primarily  operational  audits  to measure business unit performance and enforce spending controls. Arthur Andersen, WorldCom's independent  auditors,  performed  the  financial  audits  to  assess  the  reliability  and  integrity  of  the publicly reported financial information. Andersen reported to the audit committee of the company's board of directors. 18\\n\\nIn August 2001, Cooper began a routine operational audit of WorldCom's capital expenditures. Sullivan  instructed  Myers  to  restrict  the  scope  of  Cooper's  inquiry:  'We  are  not  looking  for  a comprehensive Capex audit but rather very in depth in certain areas and spending.' Cooper's audit revealed that Corporate had capital expenditures of $2.3 billion. By way of comparison, WorldCom's operations and technology group, which ran the company's entire telecommunications network, had capital  expenditures  of  $2.9  billion.  Internal  Audit  requested  an  explanation  of  Corporate's  $2.3 billion worth of projects. Cooper's team received a revised chart indicating that Corporate had only $174 million in expenditures. A footnote reference in this chart indicated that the remainder of the $2.3 billion included a metro lease buyout, line costs, and some corporate-level accruals.\\n\\nIn March 2002, the head of the wireless business unit complained to Cooper about a $400 million accrual  in  his  business  for  expected  future  cash  payments  and  bad-debt  expenses  that  had  been transferred away to pump up company earnings. Both Sullivan and the Arthur Andersen team had supported the transfer. Cooper asked one of the Andersen auditors to explain the transfer, but he\\n\\n17   This figure was subsequently reduced to $544 million when Sullivan and Myers found $227 million worth of accruals that could be released for the quarter.\\n\\n18  This audit was described as operational in nature, with an emphasis on actual spending in the field, capitalization of labor costs, and cash management. Internal Audit focused on operational and not financial statement audits at this time in order to avoid duplicating the work Andersen was doing; one employee told us that Internal Audit also wanted to avoid being seen as digging in Scott Sullivan's ' backyard' when the group reported to him.  (Beresford, Katzenbach, and Rogers, Jr., p. 119.)\",\n",
       " \"refused, telling her that he took orders only from Sullivan. Morse recalled: 'That was like putting a red flag in front of a bull. She came back to me and said, 'Go dig.'' 19\\n\\nCooper brought the issue to WorldCom's audit committee but was told by Sullivan, after the audit committee meeting, to stay away from the wireless business unit. Cooper recalled Sullivan screaming at her in a way she had never been talked to before, by anyone. p\\n\\nAlso in March 2002, SEC investigators sent WorldCom a surprise 'request for information.' The SEC  wanted  to  examine  company  data  to  learn  how  WorldCom  could  be  profitable  while  other telecom companies were reporting large losses.\\n\\nCooper decided, unilaterally and without informing Sullivan, to expand Internal Audit's scope by conducting a financial audit. Cooper asked Morse, who had good computer expertise, to access the company's computerized journal entries. Such access was granted only with Sullivan's permission, which  they  definitely  did  not  have.  But  Morse,  anticipating  a  need  for  unlimited  access  to  the company's  financial  systems,  had  previously  persuaded  a  senior  manager  in  WorldCom's  IT department to allow him to use the systems to test new software programs.\\n\\nThe software enabled Morse to find the original journal entry for virtually any expense. Morse worked at night, when his activities were less likely to clog the network. 20  By day, Morse examined his  downloaded materials in the audit library, a small windowless room. He copied incriminating data onto a CD-ROM so that the company could not subsequently destroy the evidence. Morse, a gregarious father of three, was so concerned with secrecy that he did not tell his wife what he was doing and instructed her not to touch his briefcase.\\n\\n## The Outside Auditor: Arthur Andersen\\n\\nWorldCom's independent external auditor  from  1990  to  2002  was  Arthur  Andersen.  Andersen considered  WorldCom  to  be  its  'flagship'  and  most  'highly  coveted'  client,  the  firm's  'Crown Jewel.' q  Andersen viewed its relationship with WorldCom as long term and wanted to be considered as  a  committed  member  of  WorldCom's  team.  One  indicator  of  its  commitment  came  after  the company merged with MCI. Andersen, which had a Mississippi-based team of 10-12 people working full  time  on  WorldCom's  audits,  underbilled  the  company  and  justified  the  lower  charges  as  a continuing investment in its WorldCom relationship.\\n\\nOriginally,  Andersen  did  its  audit  'the  old-fashioned  way,'  testing  thousands  of  details  of individual  transactions  and  reviewing  and  confirming  account  balances  in  WorldCom's  general ledger.  As  WorldCom's  operations  expanded  through  mergers  and  increased  scope  of  services, Andersen adopted more efficient and sophisticated audit procedures, based on analytic reviews and risk assessments. The auditors focused on identifying risks and assessing whether the client company had adequate controls in place to mitigate  those  risks,  for  example,  for  mistakenly  or  deliberately misrepresenting  financial  data.  In  practice,  Andersen  reviewed  processes,  tested  systems,  and assessed  whether  business  unit  groups  received  correct  information  from  the  field.  Its  auditors assumed that the information recorded by General Accounting was valid. It typically requested the same  20  to  30  schedules  of  high-level  summaries  to  review  each  quarter,  including  a  schedule  of\\n\\n19  Susan Pulliman and Deborah Solomon, 'Uncooking the Books,' The Wall Street Journal , October 30, 2002.\\n\\n20  In an early effort, Morse attempted to download a large number of transactions from one account and crashed the system, which drew attention to his efforts.\",\n",
       " \"## For the exclusive use of J. Sng, 2025.\\n\\ntopside entries made by General Accounting directly to the corporate general ledger after the close of a quarter. r\\n\\nAndersen  also  assessed  the  risk  that  expenditures  for  payroll,  spare  parts,  movable  parts,  and capital projects were being properly recorded and classified as expenses or assets by reviewing the relevant approval process. For line costs, Andersen assessed the risk that line-cost liabilities might be understated or overstated by testing whether the domestic telco accounting group received accurate information from the field. It did not perform comparable tests for the international line-cost group even after WorldCom employees told Andersen's U.K. audit team about a corporate reversal of $34 million in line-cost accruals after the first quarter of 2000. s  Andersen focused primarily on the risk that  WorldCom  revenues  would  be  misstated  because  of  errors  or  inaccurate  records,  not  by deliberate misrepresentation.\\n\\nBetween 1999 and 2001, Andersen's risk management software program rated WorldCom as a 'high-risk' client for committing fraud, a conclusion that its auditors upgraded to 'maximum risk' because  of volatility  in  the  telecommunications  industry,  the  company's  active  merger  and acquisition  plans,  and  its  reliance  on  a  high  stock  price  for  acquisitions.  The  Andersen  concurring partner  said  at  the  time  of  the  1999  risk  upgrade,  'If  this  job  is  not  maximum,  none  are.' t   The engagement  manager  stated  that  there  were  'probably  few  other  engagements  where  [Andersen] ha[d] a higher risk.'\\n\\nBut  the  Andersen  audit  team  for  WorldCom  did  not  modify  its  analytic  audit  approach  and continued  to  audit  WorldCom  as  a  'moderate-risk'  client.  Andersen  could  have  identified  the fraudulent  topside  entries  (accrual  reversals  and  capitalized  line  costs)  from  a  review  of  the company's  general  ledger,  its  primary  transactional  accounting  record. u   WorldCom,  however, repeatedly refused Andersen's request to access the computerized general ledger. Also, Andersen's analytic  review  procedures,  properly  performed,  should  have  triggered  a  search  for  accounting irregularities when WorldCom's quarterly financial statements reported stable financial ratios during a period of severe decline in the telecommunications industry: '[M]anagement's ability to continue to meet  aggressive  revenue  growth  targets,  and  maintain  a  42%  line  cost  expense-to-revenue  ratio, should have raised questions. Instead of wondering how this could be, Andersen appeared to have been comforted by the absence of variances. Indeed, this absence led Andersen to conclude that no follow-up work was required.' v\\n\\nMyers,  Stephanie  Scott,  and  Mark  Willson  instructed  WorldCom  staff  about  what  information could and could not be shared with Andersen. When Andersen auditors asked to speak with Ronald Lomenzo, senior vice president of financial operations, who oversaw international line-cost accruals, the request was refused. One employee commented: 'Myers or Stephanie Scott would never permit it to happen.' w  In 1998, WorldCom's treasurer told the person in charge of security for WorldCom's computerized  consolidation  and  financial  reporting  system  never  to  give  Andersen  access.  One employee  said  that  she  was  specifically  instructed  not  to  tell  Andersen  that  senior  management orchestrated adjustments to domestic line-cost accruals. Myers told one employee who had continued to  talk  with  Andersen's  U.K.  auditors,  'Do  not  have  any  more  meetings  with  Andersen  for  any reason. . . . Mark Willson has already told you this once. Don't make me ask you again.' x\\n\\nWorldCom also  withheld  information,  altered  documents,  omitted  information  from  requested materials, and transferred millions of dollars in account balances to mislead Andersen. In fact, special monthly revenue reports were prepared for Andersen:\\n\\nWorldCom  provided  Andersen  with  altered  MonRevs  [monthly  revenue  reports]  that removed  several  of  the  more  transparently  problematic  revenue  items  from  the  Corporate Unallocated schedule, and buried the revenue for these items elsewhere in the report. . . . After\",\n",
       " \"the third quarter of 2001, Stephanie Scott became concerned about how Andersen would react to the size of Corporate Unallocated revenue. . . . In the version prepared for Andersen, the Corporate Unallocated revenue items could no longer be identified by name and amount. . . . These items were removed from the Corporate Unallocated schedule and subsumed within a sales region's total revenue number. y\\n\\nAndersen rated WorldCom's compliance with requests for information as 'fair,' never informing the audit committee about any restrictions on its access to information or personnel.\\n\\n## The Board of Directors\\n\\nBetween 1999 and 2002, nonexecutive members made up more than 50% of WorldCom's Board of Directors.  The  board  members,  most  of  whom  were  former  owners,  officers,  or  directors  of companies  acquired  by  WorldCom,  included  experts  in  law,  finance,  and  the  telecommunications industry (see Exhibit 4 ).  Bert Roberts, Jr., former CEO of MCI, was chairman from 1998 until 2002. His actual role, however, was honorary. CEO Ebbers presided over board meetings and determined their agendas.\\n\\nThe  board's  primary  interaction  with  WorldCom  matters  occurred  at  regularly  scheduled meetings  that  took  place  about  four  to  six  times  a  year.  With  the  occasional  exception  of  Bobbitt (Audit) and Kellett (Compensation), none of the outside directors had regular communications with Ebbers, Sullivan, or any other WorldCom employee outside of board or committee meetings. Prior to April 2002, the outside directors never met by themselves.\\n\\nA  week  prior  to  board  meetings  directors  received  a  packet  of  information  that  contained  an agenda,  financial  information  from  the  previous  quarter,  draft  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting, investor  relations  information  such  as  analyst  call  summaries,  and  resolutions  to  consider  at  the upcoming meeting. The meetings consisted of a series of short presentations from the chairman of the compensation  and  stock  option  committee  about  officer  loans  and  senior  level  compensation;  the chairman of the audit committee; 21  the general counsel, who discussed legal and regulatory issues; CFO Sullivan, who discussed financial issues at a high level of generality for 30 minutes to an hour; and, on occasion, COO Ron Beaumont. This format did not change, even when the board considered large multibillion-dollar deals. 22\\n\\nSullivan manipulated the information related to capital expenditures and line costs presented to the  board.  His  presentation  of  total  capital  spending  for  the  quarter  included  a  breakdown  on spending  for  local,  data/long  haul,  Internet,  and  international  operations  and  major  projects.  The board, which was expecting cuts in capital expenditures, received information that reflected a steady decrease. However, the spending cuts were far greater than they were led to believe. The hundreds of millions of dollars of capitalized line costs inflated the capital expenditures reported to the board (see Table A ).\\n\\n21  A nominating committee, responsible for filling vacancies on the board, met only when vacancies occurred.\\n\\n22  Committees met separately in hour-long sessions.

To gain the knowledge  necessary  to  function  effectively  .  .  .  would  have  required  a  very  substantial amount of energy, expertise by at least some of its members, and time-certainly more than the three to five hours a year the Audit Committee met. aa\\n\\nEbbers,  in  addition  to  his  full-time  job  as  WorldCom  CEO,  for  which  he  was  generously compensated, 23  had acquired and was managing several unrelated businesses, including hotels, real estate ventures, a Canadian cattle ranch, timberlands, a rice farm, a luxury-yacht-building company, an operating marina, a lumber mill, a country club, a trucking company, and a minor league hockey team. bb   Ebbers  financed  the  acquisitions  of  many  of  these  businesses  by  commercial  bank  loans secured by his personal WorldCom stock. When WorldCom stock began to decline in 2000, Ebbers received margin calls from his bankers. In September 2000, the compensation committee began, at Ebbers's request, to approve loans and guarantees from WorldCom so that Ebbers would not have to sell his stock to meet the margin calls. The full board learned about the loans to Ebbers in November 2000, since the loans needed to be disclosed in the company's third-quarter 10-Q report. The board ratified  and  approved  the  compensation  committee's  actions.  WorldCom  did  not  receive  any collateral  from  Ebbers  or  his  business  interests  to  secure  these  loans.  Nor  did  the  compensation committee  oversee  Ebbers's  use  of  the  funds,  some  of  which  were  used  to  pay  his  companies' operating expenses. By April 29, 2002, the loans and guarantees to Ebbers exceeded $400 million.\\n\\nAccording to the investigative committee, WorldCom's board was 'distant and detached from the workings of the Company.' cc  It did not establish processes to encourage employees to contact outside directors about any concerns they might have about accounting entries or operational matters. dd\\n\\nThe Board played far too small a role in the life, direction and culture of the company. The Audit  Committee  did  not  engage  to  the  extent  necessary  to  understand  and  address  the financial issues presented by this large and extremely complex business: its members were not in a position to exercise critical judgment on accounting and reporting issues, or on the nontraditional  audit  strategy  of  their  outside  auditor.  The  Compensation  Committee  dispensed extraordinarily  generous  rewards  without  adequate  attention  to  the  incentives  they  created,\\n\\n23  Ebbers was ranked, for several years in a row, as among the highest paid CEOs in the United States.\",\n",
       " \"Accounting Fraud at WorldCom and presided over enormous loans to Ebbers that we believe were antithetical to shareholder interests and unjustifiable on any basis. ee\\n\\nOn April  26,  2002,  the  nonexecutive  directors  met  by  themselves,  for  the  first  time,  to  discuss Ebbers's delay in providing collateral for his loans from the company.  The directors, dissatisfied with Ebbers's lack of strategic vision and his diminished reputation on Wall Street, voted unanimously to ask  Ebbers  for  his  resignation.  Within  three  days,  the  board  signed  a  separation  agreement  with Ebbers that included a restructuring of his loans into a five-year note and a promise of a $1.5 million annual payment for life. ff, 24\\n\\n## The Endgame\\n\\nCooper's  internal  audit  team,  by  the  beginning  of  June  2002,  had  discovered  $3  billion  in questionable  expenses,  including  $500  million  in  undocumented  computer  expenses.  On  June  11, Cooper met with Sullivan, who asked her to delay the capital expenditure audit until after the third quarter.  Cooper  refused.  On  June  17,  Cooper  and  Glyn  Smith,  a  manager  on  her  team,  went  to Vinson's office and asked her to explain several questionable capital expense accounting entries that Internal Audit had found. Vinson admitted that she had made many of the entries but did not have any support for them. Cooper immediately went to Yates's office, several feet away, and asked him for  an  explanation.  Yates  denied  knowledge  of  the  entries  and  referred  Cooper  to  Myers,  who acknowledged the entries and admitted that no accounting standards existed to support them. Myers allegedly  said  the  entries  should  not  have  been  made,  but  that  once  it  had  started,  it  was  hard  to stop. 25\\n\\nOn  June  20,  Cooper  and  her  internal  audit  team  met  in  Washington,  D.C.  with  the  audit committee and disclosed their findings of inappropriate capitalized expenses. When Sullivan could not  provide  an  adequate  explanation  of  these  transactions,  the  board  told  Sullivan  and  Myers  to resign immediately or they would be fired. Myers resigned. Sullivan did not and was promptly fired. On June 25, 2002, WorldCom announced that its profits had been inflated by $3.8 billion over the previous five quarters. Nasdaq immediately halted trading of WorldCom's stock. Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on WorldCom bonds from B+ to CCC-.\\n\\nOn June 26, the SEC initiated a civil suit of fraud against WorldCom. Attorneys in the U.S. Justice Department launched criminal investigations into the actions of Bernie Ebbers, Scott Sullivan, David Myers, Buford Yates, Betty Vinson, and Troy Normand.\\n\\n24   Subsequently,  the  corporate  monitor  and  WorldCom's new management cancelled the $1.5 million annual payment and took control of some of Ebbers's personal business assets.\\n\\n25  Pulliman and Solomon.\",\n",
       " \"## For the exclusive use of J. Sng, 2025.\\n\\n104-071\\n\\n## Epilogue\\n\\nArthur Andersen was never held to account for its WorldCom audits. On June 13, 2002, after a sixweek trial and 10 days of deliberations, jurors convicted Arthur Andersen for obstructing justice for its destruction of Enron documents while on notice of a federal investigation. After the verdict, the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  announced  that  the  accounting  firm  would  cease  practicing before the commission by August 31, 2002.\\n\\nOn  August  28,  2002,  David  Myers  pleaded  guilty  to  three  felony  charges:  securities  fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and making false filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In October 2002, Yates, Vinson, and Normand each pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, charges that carried a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Vinson was released on a bond secured by $25,000 of equity in her home. She was now working as an accountant for a large Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. 26  On March 2, 2004, Sullivan pleaded guilty to federal fraud and conspiracy charges that he deceived the public, the SEC, securities analysts, and others about WorldCom's true financial condition. He admitted: 'I took these actions,  knowing  they  were  wrong,  in  a  misguided  effort  to  preserve  the  company  to  allow  it  to withstand what I believed were temporary financial difficulties. . . . I deeply regret my actions and sincerely apologize for the harm they have caused.' 27  Sullivan agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of his Florida home, on the market for $13 million, for restitution to WorldCom investors and to cooperate with the government in its case against Ebbers.\\n\\nAlso on March 2, 2004, the U.S. Justice Department indicted Bernie Ebbers, who was then teaching Sunday school in Jackson, Mississippi. Ebbers asserted his innocence to the government's fraud and conspiracy charges. On March 15, 2005, after a six week trial, during which Ebbers argued that he was a salesman not a numbers man, the jury found him guilty of fraud, conspiracy, and filing false documents with regulators. He was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison.\\n\\nOn August 5, 2005 Betty Vinson was sentenced to 5 months in prison, and 5 months of home detention, terms that she has now completed serving. David Myers and Buford Yates received jail sentences of a year and a day. Troy Norman did not receive a prison sentence because of his attempts to leave the company rather than commit accounting fraud. Scott Sullivan was sentenced to five years in prison. His sentence had been set at 80% less time than Ebbers because of his cooperation with the prosecution.\\n\\nCynthia Cooper remained as WorldCom's senior Internal Audit executive until July 2004. She was not promoted at WorldCom (subsequently MCI), and no senior company executive ever personally thanked  her.  Several  employees  resented  Cooper,  believing  that  her  revelation  of  accounting irregularities had led to WorldCom's bankruptcy. In December 2002, Time magazine named her as one of its 'Persons of the Year.' In 2004, the AICPA Hall of Fame inducted her as its first woman member. In 2004, Cooper left WorldCom to become a consultant and speaker on ethical and moral leadership. 28\\n\\nBernie Ebbers entered prison on September 27, 2006. He must serve at least 85% of his term.\\n\\n26  Susan Pulliman, 'Over the Line,' The Wall Street Journal , June 23, 2003.\\n\\n27  Larry  Neumeister,  'Former  WorldCom  chief  Ebbers  charged,  CFO  Sullivan  agrees  to  plea  deal,' Associated Press , March 2, 2004, http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2004/03/02/former\\\\_WorldCom\\\\_chief\\\\_ebbers\\\\_charged\\\\_cfo\\\\_sullivan\\\\_ agrees\\\\_to\\\\_plea\\\\_deal/, accessed March 26, 2004.\\n\\n28  Source: http://www.nationwidespeakers.com/speakers/cynthia\\\\_cooper.html , accessed September 14, 2007.\",\n",
